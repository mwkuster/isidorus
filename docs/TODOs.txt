A (most likely incomplete) list of ToDos we are aware of:
========================================================= 

* "poor man's transactions": remember imported topics + assocs and remove 
  them again if the general import fails later. Or, even better, make use of
  transaction support in elephant if and when the backend supports it in a way
  we can use.

* reverse hack with removed '#' in references
 
* handle multiple TMs in one repository

    Possible approaches:
  
     * use the TMDM approach and link topics to a TM object

     * just use a name similar to the tm-id. we then need two ids, one
       for the concrete name of the import and another one for the
       logical name of the TM
     
* admin interface for the 

    * configuration of the sytem: import and export of feeds
      etc. incl. consolidation of the present feed configuration


* TMCL: implement a constraint language --- but the one under ISO
     FCD ballot, see http://www.itscj.ipsj.or.jp/sc34/open/1053.pdf or
     NPCL? Or adapt SPARQL?
