=============================================
Installing Isidorus
=============================================

Dependencies
================

 * Berkeley DB 4.5 or 4.6 including its development files

 * sbcl (1.0.17 or newer)

and the following Lisp packages:

Elephant
----------------

Install the persistence framework elephant in its unstable version

darcs get http://www.common-lisp.net/project/elephant/darcs/elephant-unstable/

Also install all of its dependencies as described in elephant_install.txt. In particular these are:
 * (require 'asdf-install)
 * (asdf-install:install 'CL-BASE64)
 * (asdf-install:install 'uffi) 

For uffi you need the libc development files (libc6-dev linux-libc-dev
zlib1g-dev under Linux). Under Ubuntu both packages exist also as
Debian packages. Cf. also http://uffi.b9.com/

Configure elephant for your platform in my-config.sexp and link its
asd-files to the system-wide install


cxml
-------

CL-USER> (asdf:operate 'asdf:load-op 'asdf-install)
CL-USER> (asdf-install:install 'cxml)

uuid
--------

Download the ironclad library from
http://www.method-combination.net/lisp/files/ironclad.tar.gz and link the asd-file to
the sbcl system path. Ironclad is a prerequisite for the UUID library

Download the UUID library from http://dardoria.net/software/uuid.tar.gz
and link the asd-file to the sbcl system path

fiveam (unittests)
-------------------

CL-USER> (asdf-install:install 'fiveam)

Under Ubuntu Linux, fiveam exists also as a Debian package.

Installing pathnames
---------------------

Pathnames is part of Seibel's libraries (http://www.gigamonkeys.com/book/) and
included with isidorus under src/external. Link the asd-file to the sbcl system path.

Hunchentoot
--------------

Hunchentoot (http://www.weitz.de/hunchentoot/) is also
asdf-install'able:

(asdf-install:install 'hunchentoot)

It requires a significant number of auxiliary libraries and the
installation hung once during the process. I installed a few libraries
manually then:

 * CL-PPCRE
 * CL-FAD

On restart, the installation completed correctly

Test: 
  (asdf:oos 'asdf:load-op :hunchentoot-test)
  (hunchentoot:start-server :port 4242)

cl-json
---------

Download the parenscript library:

darcs get http://common-lisp.net/project/ucw/repos/parenscript 

Link the asd-file to the sbcl system path.

Download the cl-json library:

darcs get http://common-lisp.net/project/cl-json/darcs/cl-json

Link the asd-file to the sbcl system path.


Drakma
---------

Drakma (http://weitz.de/drakma) also follows the same pattern:

(asdf-install:install 'drakma)


Starting Isidorus
=====================

(asdf:operate 'asdf:load-op 'isidorus)
